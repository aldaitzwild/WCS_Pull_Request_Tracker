        TooManyFields: This rule limits the maximum number of fields (instance variables) in a class. Here, the maximum
        value is set to 40.
        ExcessivePublicCount: This rule is excluded, so it will not apply. It concerns an excessive number of public
        methods and variables in a class.
        ExcessiveClassComplexity: This rule is also excluded. It checks if a class's complexity (number of methods and
        instance variables) is too high.
        Superglobals: This rule is excluded. It concerns the use of PHP superglobals, such as $_GET, $_POST, etc.
        CouplingBetweenObjects: This rule limits coupling between objects (the number of classes a class is linked to).
        Here, the maximum value is set to 20.
        ShortVariable: This rule concerns variable names that are too short. Here, it is modified to allow the variable
        names "id" and "qb" as exceptions.
        UnusedFormalParameter: This rule is excluded. It checks if a method has formal parameters not used in its body.

        Lastly, there are exclusion patterns that prevent these rules from being applied to certain specific files or
        folders:

        src/Migrations
        src/Kernel.php
        src/Security
